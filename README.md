Repository containing scripts (MATLAB) used for processing data reported in Sprague, Itthipuripat, Vo & Serences, 2018, J Neurophysiology (available [here](https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/jn.00059.2018))

I'm still working through scripts to organize & document procedures, so this repository will be updated throughout late May 2018.

If you need access to materials before then, or have any questions, please feel free to contact me
